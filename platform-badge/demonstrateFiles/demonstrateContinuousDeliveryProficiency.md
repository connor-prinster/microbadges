# Demonstrate Continuous Delivery Proficiency

## Tasks

* What is continuous delivery?
* Review [this confluence page](https://fhconfluence.churchofjesuschrist.org/display/EPT/Continuous+Delivery) that describes continuous delivery and answer each of the following:
    * What is Electric Flow?
    * In the continuous delivery pipeline what is the purpose of a commit?
    * Where is a release candidate created?
    * What thing does integration testing in a production-like environment?
* Demonstrate how you would find the status of a build.
* Demonstrate how you would find the status of a deployment.
* What is the difference between release and deployment?
* What is the difference between push button deployment and automatic deployment?  When would you use each?
* Where are previous versions of one of your team's products or services stored

### What is Continuous Delivery?
It is the idea that we continually add new code, configuration, and the like which then is pushed out to production as soon as possible.

The purposes are this:
* there are low risk releases. Single function changes will have less of an effect than if you had a huge release later on
* you can push out faster so a phased software delivery doesn't take up unnecessary time
* lower costs because it takes less of fixed costs shown with release processes

I referenced [this](https://continuousdelivery.com/) to answer some of the reasonings for CI/CD
